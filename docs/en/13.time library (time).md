[CO](https://github.com/idealvin/co) is an elegant, performant C++ base library. CO supports Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms. This documentation describes its modules and their usages.

## 13. Time library(time)

include: [base/time.h](https://github.com/idealvin/co/blob/master/base/time.h).

### 13.1 monotonic time

`monotonic time` is implemented on most platforms as the time since system startup. It is generally used for timing and is more stable than system time, as it is not affected by system time.

- Code example

```cpp
int64 us = now::us(); // Microsecond
int64 ms = now::ms(); // Millisecond
```

### 13.2 Time string(now::str())

`now::str()` is implemented based on strftime and returns the string form of the current system time in the specified format.

- Function prototype

```cpp
// fm: Time output format
fastring str(const char* fm="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
```

- Code example

```cpp
fastring s = now::str();     // "2018-08-08 08:08:08"
fastring s = now::str("%Y"); // "2028"
```

### 13.3 sleep

Linux supports microsecond sleep, which is difficult to implement on Windows. Therefore, the time library only supports sleep in milliseconds and seconds.

- Code example

```cpp
sleep::ms(10); // sleep for 10 milliseconds
sleep::sec(1); // sleep for 1 second
```

### 13.4 Timer(Timer)

`Timer` is implemented based on monotonic time. Timer starts timing as soon as it was created.

```cpp
Timer t;
sleep::ms(10);

int64 us = t.us(); // Microsecond
int64 ms = t.ms(); // Millisecond

t.restart();       // Restart timing
```
