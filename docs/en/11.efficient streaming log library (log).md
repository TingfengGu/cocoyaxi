[CO](https://github.com/idealvin/co) is an elegant, performant C++ base library. CO supports Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms. This documentation describes its modules and their usages.

## 11. Efficient streaming log library(log)

include: [base/log.h](https://github.com/idealvin/co/blob/master/base/log.h).

### 11.1 Basic introduction

The `log` library is a C++ streaming log library similar to [google glog](https://github.com/google/glog). Printing logs is more convenient and safer than the printf series of functions:

```cpp
LOG << "hello world" << 23;
```

The internal implementation of the log library uses an asynchronous method, the log is first written to the cache, after a certain amount or more than a certain time, the background thread writes the file together, The performance is improved by 20 to 150 times compared to glog on different platforms.

The following table is the test result of continuously printing 1 million (about 50 bytes each) info level logs on different platforms:

| log vs glog | google glog | co log |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| win2012 HDD | 1.6MB/s | 180MB/s |
| win10 ssd | 3.7MB/s | 560MB/s |
| mac ssd | 17MB/s | 450MB/s |
| linux ssd | 54MB/s | 1023MB/s |

### 11.2 Api Introduction

The log library provides only two API functions to the outside world:
```cpp
void init();
void close();
```

`Log:: init()` needs to be called once at the beginning of the `main` function. Because the log library depends on the flag library, the main function is generally written as follows:
```cpp
#include "base/flag.h"
#include "base/log.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    flag::init(argc, argv);
    log::init();
}
```

`log::close()` writes the log in the cache to a file, and exits the background log writing thread. The log library internally captures signals such as `SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT`, and calls this function before the program exits to avoid losing the log.

### 11.3 Print different levels of logs

Logs are divided into 5 levels: debug, info, warning, error and fatal. You can use macros DLOG, LOG, WLOG, ELOG and FLOG print 5 different levels of logs:

```cpp
DLOG << "this is DEBUG log " << 23;
LOG << "this is INFO log " << 23;
WLOG << "this is WARNING log " << 23;
ELOG << "this is ERROR log " << 23;
FLOG << "this is FATAL log " << 23;
```

Print the `fatal` log, which generally indicates that a fatal error occurred in the program, the log library will print the function call stack information of the current thread and terminate the running of the program.

### 11.4 Condition log(LOG_IF)

The log library also provides the `IF` version of the macro, which accepts a conditional parameter and prints the log when the specified conditions are met.

- Code example

```cpp
DLOG_IF(cond) << "this is DEBUG log " << 23;
LOG_IF(cond) << "this is INFO log " << 23;
WLOG_IF(cond) << "this is WARNING log " << 23;
ELOG_IF(cond) << "this is ERROR log " << 23;
FLOG_IF(cond) << "this is FATAL log " << 23;
```

### 11.5 Print log every N entries(LOG_EVERY_N)

The log library provides `LOG_EVERY_N` and other macros that support printing logs every N entries, these macros use atomic operations internally to ensure thread safety.

- Code example

```cpp
// print log 1, 33, 65......
DLOG_EVERY_N(32) << "this is DEBUG log " << 23;
LOG_EVERY_N(32) << "this is INFO log " << 23;
WLOG_EVERY_N(32) << "this is WARNING log " << 23;
ELOG_EVERY_N(32) << "this is ERROR log " << 23;
```

FLOG does not have this function because the program hangs as soon as FLOG prints.

### 11.6 Print the first N logs(LOG_FIRST_N)

The log library provides `LOG_FIRST_N` and other macros to support printing the first N logs, these macros also use atomic operations internally to ensure thread safety.

- Code example

```cpp
// print the first 10 logs
DLOG_FIRST_N(10) << "this is DEBUG log " << 23;
LOG_FIRST_N(10) << "this is INFO log " << 23;
WLOG_FIRST_N(10) << "this is WARNING log " << 23;
ELOG_FIRST_N(10) << "this is ERROR log " << 23;
```

### 11.7 CHECK: Enhanced assert

The log library provides a series of CHECK macros, which can be regarded as enhanced asserts, these macros will not be cleared in DEBUG mode.

- Code example

```cpp
CHECK(1 + 1 == 2) << "say something here";
CHECK_EQ(1 + 1, 2);  // ==
CHECK_NE(1 + 1, 2);  // !=
CHECK_GE(1 + 1, 2);  // >=
CHECK_LE(1 + 1, 2);  // <=
CHECK_GT(1 + 1, 2);  // >  greater than
CHECK_LT(1 + 1, 2);  // <  less than
```

When CHECK fails, the LOG library will first call `log::close()` to write the log, then print the function call stack information of the current thread, and then exit the program.

### 11.8 Configuration item

- log_dir

Specifies the log directory, the default is the `logs` directory under the current directory, it will be created automatically if it does not exist.

```cpp
DEF_string(log_dir, "logs", "Log dir, will be created if not exists");
```

- log_file_name

Specify the log file name (without path), which is empty by default, and use the program name as the log file name.

```cpp
DEF_string(log_file_name, "", "name of log file, using exename if empty");
```

- min_log_level

Specifies the minimum level of printing logs, which is used to mask the low-level logs, the default is 0, and logs of all levels are printed.

```cpp
DEF_int32(min_log_level, 0, "write logs at or above this level");
```

- max_log_file_size

Specifies the maximum size of the log file, the default size is 256M, if the file size exceeds this size, a new log file is generated and the old log file is renamed.

```cpp
DEF_int64(max_log_file_size, 256 << 20, "max size of log file, default: 256MB");
```

- max_log_file_num

Specifies the maximum number of log files. The default is 8. If this value is exceeded, old log files are deleted.

```cpp
DEF_uint32(max_log_file_num, 8, "max number of log files");
```

- max_log_buffer_size

Specifies the maximum size of the log cache. The default value is 32M. If this value is exceeded, half of the logs are discarded.

```cpp
DEF_uint32(max_log_buffer_size, 32 << 20, "max size of log buffer, default: 32MB");
```

### 11.9 Functional and performance testing


See the test code for the LOG library [test/log_test.cc](https://github.com/idealvin/co/blob/master/test/log_test.cc).

```sh
# generate log.exe
cd co/test && xmake -b log && cd ../build

# print different types of logs
./log.exe

# -min_log_level specify the minimum level of output logs
./log.exe -min_log_level=1   # 0-4: debug,info,warning,error,fatal 

# performance test, one thread continuously prints 1 million info-level logs
./log.exe -perf
```
