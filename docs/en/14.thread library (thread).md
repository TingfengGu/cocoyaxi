[CO](https://github.com/idealvin/co) is an elegant, performant C++ base library. CO supports Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms. This documentation describes its modules and their usages.

## 14. thtead library(thread)

include: [base/thread.h](https://github.com/idealvin/co/blob/master/base/thread.h).

### 14.1 Mutex(Mutex)

`Mutex` is a mutex commonly used in multi-threaded programming. At the same time, only one thread can grab the lock, and other threads must wait for the lock to be released.

There is also a read-write lock, which allows multiple threads to read at the same time, but at most only one thread can write. In practical applications, the read-write lock performance is poor, so this library has removed the read-write lock.

Corresponding to `Mutex`, there is a` MutexGuard` class for automatic acquisition and release of mutex locks.

- Code example

```cpp
Mutex m;
m.lock();         // Acquires the lock, if the lock is already occupied by another thread, the current thread will block
m.unlock();       // Release lock
m.try_lock();     // Get the lock. If the lock is already occupied by other threads, return false, the current thread will not block

MutexGuard g(m);  // Call m.lock () in the constructor to acquire the lock, and call m.unlock () in the destructor to release the lock
```

### 14.2 Sync event(SyncEvent)

`SyncEvent` is a synchronization mechanism commonly used in multi-threaded programming and is suitable for the producer-consumer model.

- SyncEvent constructor description

```cpp
// manual_reset: whether to manually set the synchronization status of events at the end of wait
// signaled:     whether the initial state of the event is signaled
SyncEvent(bool manual_reset=false, bool signaled=false);
```

- Code example

```cpp
SyncEvent ev;
ev.wait();                 // Thread A, waiting for event synchronization, the wait() function automatically sets the event status to unsignaled
ev.signal();               // Thread B, event synchronization notification

SyncEvent ev(true, false); // Enable manual_reset, waiting threads need to manually set event synchronization status
ev.wait(1000);             // Thread A, waiting 1000 milliseconds until the event is synchronized or timed out
ev.reset();                // Thread A, manually set event status to unsignaled
ev.signal();               // Thread B, event synchronization notification
```

### 14.3 Thread(Thread)

The `Thread` class is a wrapper around a thread. When a Thread object is created, the thread is started, and when the thread function finishes executing, the thread automatically exits.

In addition to the constructor and destructor, the Thread class provides only two methods:

- `join()`, Block, wait for the thread function to finish executing, and then exit the thread
- `detach()`, Does not block, automatically releases system resources when the thread function finishes executing

- Code example

```cpp
// start thread
Thread x(f);                        // void f();
Thread x(f, p);                     // void f(void*);  void* p;
Thread x(&T::f, &t);                // void T::f();  T t;
Thread x(std::bind(f, 7));          // void f(int v);
Thread x(std::bind(&T::f, &t, 7));  // void T::f(int v);  T t;

// Block, wait for the thread function to finish executing
x.join();                           

// Starts the thread and destroys the Thread object. The thread runs independently of the Thread object.
Thread(f).detach();
```

### 14.4 Get the id of the current thread

`current_thread_id ()` is used to get the id of the current thread. The thread library uses [TLS] (https://wiki.osdev.org/Thread_Local_Storage) to save the thread id. Each thread only needs one system call.

- special reminder

The Linux glibc has added the gettid system call since `2.30`. To avoid conflicts, the thread library has removed the earlier provided gettid interface and changed it to` current_thread_id`.

- Code example

```cpp
int id = current_thread_id();
```

### 14.5 thread_ptr based on TLS

`thread_ptr` is similar to`std::unique_ptr`, but uses the `TLS` mechanism internally. Each thread sets and has its own ptr.

- Code example

```cpp
struct T {
    void run() {
        cout << current_thread_id() << endl;
    }
};

thread_ptr<T> pt;

// Executed in the thread function of thread 1
if (pt == NULL) pt.reset(new T); 
pt->run();  // Print id of thread 1

// Executed in a thread function in thread 2
if (pt == NULL) pt.reset(new T);
pt->run();  // Print id of thread 2
```

### 14.6 Timed task scheduler(TaskSched)

The `TaskSched` class is used for scheduling scheduled tasks. All tasks are scheduled by a single thread internally, but tasks can be added from any thread.

- TaskSched provided methods
    - run_in
    - run_every
    - run_daily

```cpp
// @f: std::function<void()> type function object

// execute f once after n seconds
void run_in(f, n);

// execute f every n seconds
void run_every(f, n);

// executed every hour: min: sec
// @hour: 0-23，default is 0
// @min:  0-59，default is 0
// @sec:  0-59，default is 0
void run_daily(f, hour=0, min=0, sec=0);
```

- Code example

```cpp
TaskSched s;                      // start task scheduling thread
s.run_in(f, 3);                   // execute f once after 3 seconds    void f();
s.run_every(std::bind(f, 0), 3);  // executed f every 3 seconds        void f(int);
s.run_daily(f);                   // executed f every day at 00:00:00
s.run_daily(f, 23);               // executed f every day at 23:00:00
s.run_daily(f, 23, 30);           // executed f every day at 23:30:00
s.stop();                         // exit the task scheduling thread
```
